## MARSBox - Matt's Augmented Reality Sandbox

This project is the result of my third year university project, and is still being developed.  The code will be uploaded once I think it has been improved sufficiently.

Basic program details

* Language  - C++
* Libraries - GLFW, Kinect 2
 
Basic program steps

1. Acquire depth data from Kinect V2
2. Convert all depth data to a HSV colour via interpolation
3. Apply marching squares to the depth data to acquire contour lines
4. Draw all colours and contours to the screen
5. Repeat until program is stopped

Here is a demonstation video from this year's project fair.
